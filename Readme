# AI-Driven Character Animation Addon for Blender
## Overview
This addon uses AI to animate characters in Blender. It uses a pre-trained model to predict the pose of the character based on input data, and then applies that pose to the character's rig.

## Installation
1. Download the addon from the repository.
Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory of your choice.
2. Open Blender and go to the "Edit" menu, then select "Preferences".
3. In the "Add-ons" tab, click "Install..." and select the directory where you extracted the addon.
4. Enable the addon by checking the box next to its name.
## Requirements
- Blender 2.80 or later
- Python 3.7 or later
The following Python packages:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- mediapipe
- opencv-python
## Usage
Loading the AI Model
Go to the "Window" menu, then select "Toggle System Console" to open the console.
Run the "Load AI Model" operator by typing bpy.ops.ai.load_model() in the console.
The addon will attempt to load the AI model from the models/saved_models/action_model.keras file in the addon's directory. If the file is not found, an error message will be displayed.
## Animating the Character
Select the rigged character object in the scene.
Go to the "Window" menu, then select "Toggle System Console" to open the console.
Run the "Animate Character" operator by typing bpy.ops.ai.animate_character() in the console.
The addon will use the loaded AI model to predict the pose of the character and apply it to the rig.
## Webcam Animation
Select the rigged character object in the scene.
Go to the "Window" menu, then select "Toggle System Console" to open the console.
Run the "Webcam Animate Rig" operator by typing bpy.ops.ai.webcam_animate() in the console.
The addon will use the webcam to capture video and apply the predicted pose to the rig in real-time.
## Troubleshooting
If the AI model fails to load, check that the models/saved_models/action_model.keras file exists in the addon's directory.
If the character's rig is not updating correctly, check that the rig is selected and that the rig_object_name property is set correctly in the scene.
Known Issues
The addon may not work correctly with all types of rigs or characters.
The webcam animation feature may not work correctly on all systems.
## Future Development
Improve the accuracy of the AI model
Add support for more types of rigs and characters
Improve the performance of the webcam animation feature
